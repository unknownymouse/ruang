"""Rate-limit primitives for the Agent API.

Two orthogonal concerns live here:

1. ``PLATFORM_DAILY_POST_LIMIT`` — channel-aligned caps on how many
   scheduled-or-published PlatformPost rows an API key may create per
   ``SocialAccount`` per rolling 24h window. Numbers come from each
   platform's own developer docs (May 2026); see ``docs/agent-api.md``
   for the source links. The publisher's own ``RateLimitState`` tracks
   the *outgoing* upstream platform quota separately — these layers
   compose; neither replaces the other.

2. Per-key / per-workspace / per-IP HTTP throttles via ``django-ratelimit``,
   exposed as small wrapper helpers so each router stays declarative.

The 429 body shape is uniform across all tiers so agents can self-throttle
on ``tier`` without parsing free text.
