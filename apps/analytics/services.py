    ``PostInsightsSnapshot.value`` stores the cumulative-lifetime count for
    that metric at sync time. To get "what happened on day D" we take
    ``snapshot(D) - snapshot(latest before D)`` per post and sum across the
    account's posts. Used as a hero/chart fallback when no
    ``AccountInsightsSnapshot`` rows exist for the metric — keeps the main
    page consistent with the per-post drawer for platforms that ship without
    an account-level analytics API.

    Returns ``(daily_totals, max_captured_at)``. The caller folds
    ``max_captured_at`` into the bundle's freshness signal so a fallback-only
    YouTube/TikTok response doesn't report "no data yet".

    Three correctness rules in the iteration:
      * The query is bounded to ``[start, end]`` for performance. The first
        observation per post (typical for accounts that just connected:
        backfill writes a single cumulative-lifetime row dated today) needs
        special handling — naively crediting ``value - 0`` dumps the entire
        lifetime onto the snapshot day. Three cases:
          - Post published BEFORE the window: anchor ``prev_value`` and
            skip the credit. The cumulative is mostly pre-window activity
            we can't attribute to days we don't have snapshots for.
          - Post published INSIDE the window: distribute the cumulative
            uniformly across ``[pub_day, snapshot_day]`` so the lifetime
            isn't piled onto the snapshot day. This matches what Codex's
            adversarial review flagged — for an account where backfill
            writes a single lifetime snapshot per post, the chart would
            otherwise inflate today by the sum of every in-window post's
            lifetime totals.
          - Missing/post-snapshot ``published_at``: fall back to crediting
            the snapshot day. Conservative, matches legacy behavior.
      * A negative delta (count reset, deleted reactions, platform recount)
        skips both the credit AND the ``prev_value`` advance, so a later
        recovery is measured against the pre-reset high-water mark instead
        of being over-credited.
